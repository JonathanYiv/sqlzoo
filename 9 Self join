1) SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM stops;

2) SELECT id
FROM stops
WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart';

3) SELECT id, name
FROM stops JOIN route ON stops.id = route.stop
WHERE num = '4';

4) SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;

5) SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53
AND b.stop = 149;

6) SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart'
AND stopb.name = 'London Road';

7) SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Haymarket'
AND stopb.name = 'Leith';

/* In Problems 6 and 7
First, two different route tables are joined where companies and bus numbers are equal for a SELF JOIN.
You can't use just companies or bus numbers because there could be matching companies with non-matching numbers and vice versa.
This creates a table where each company's bus line (denoted by a unique pair of number and company) is matched with every other matching pair of number and company with different stops

Then, the stops table is joined as stopa where the starting stop of the above table's first subtable is paired with every matching name
Then, the stops table is joine again as stopb where the finishing stop of the above table's second subtable is paired with every matching name


So essentially, it pairs routes with itself for every unique company/bus line pair to identify all existing stop to stop routes.
Then it joins the stops table twice to name the stops.
You can then establish a relationship between two stops by using a WHERE clause to identify that two stops are both in the same row.

8) SELECT DISTINCT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart'
AND stopb.name = 'Tollcross';

9) SELECT stopb.name, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart';

10) SELECT DISTINCT to_craiglockhart.num, to_craiglockhart.company, to_craiglockhart.transfer_stop, to_sighthill.num, to_sighthill.company
FROM (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Craiglockhart') to_craiglockhart
JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') to_sighthill
ON to_craiglockhart.transfer_stop = to_sighthill.transfer_stop
ORDER BY CAST(to_craiglockhart.num AS int)


# Below is thinking

Finds every stop that starts at Craiglockhart
SELECT stopb.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart';

Finds every stop which gets to Sighthill
SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill';

This appropriately merges the two tables. I need to identify the right things...
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT stopb.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') table1 JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') table2 ON table1.transfer_stop = table2.transfer_stop


This appropriately merges the two tables. I need to identify the right things...
SELECT table1.num, table1.company, table1.transfer_stop, table2.num, table2.company
FROM (SELECT stopb.name AS transfer_stop, b.company, b.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') table1 JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, b.company, b.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') table2 ON table1.transfer_stop = table2.transfer_stop
ORDER BY table1.num DESC


Shows the first stop, the company and bus number, and the transfer stop.
SELECT stopa.name, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS transfer_stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart';

Shows the transfer stop, the company and bus number, and the final stop.
SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill';

Appropriately combines both tables
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT stopa.name, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS transfer_stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') first_bus JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') second_bus ON first_bus.transfer_stop = second_bus.transfer_stop


hmmm
SELECT first_bus.num, first_bus.company, first_bus.transfer_stop, second_bus.num, second_bus.company
FROM (SELECT stopa.name, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS transfer_stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') first_bus JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') second_bus ON first_bus.transfer_stop = second_bus.transfer_stop


Added where clause so first stop is Craiglockhart and last stop is Sighthill
SELECT first_bus.num, first_bus.company, first_bus.transfer_stop, second_bus.num, second_bus.company
FROM (SELECT stopa.name AS first_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS transfer_stop
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') first_bus 
JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS final_stop
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') second_bus 
ON first_bus.transfer_stop = second_bus.transfer_stop
	WHERE first_bus.first_stop = 'Craiglockhart'
		AND second_bus.final_stop = 'Sighthill'




Shows the first stop, the company and bus number, and the transfer stop.
SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Craiglockhart';

Shows the transfer stop, the company and bus number, and the final stop.
SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill';


SELECT *
FROM (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Craiglockhart') to_craiglockhart
JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
	  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
	  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
	  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') to_sighthill
ON to_craiglockhart.transfer_stop = to_sighthill.transfer_stop


solution
SELECT DISTINCT to_craiglockhart.num, to_craiglockhart.company, to_craiglockhart.transfer_stop, to_sighthill.num, to_sighthill.company
FROM (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name

	  WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') to_sighthill
ON to_craiglockhart.transfer_stop = to_sighthill.transfer_stop
ORDER BY CAST(to_craiglockhart.num AS int)


Found the solution but this does not work
SELECT DISTINCT first_bus.num, first_bus.company, first_bus.transfer_stop, second_bus.num, second_bus.company
	FROM (SELECT stopa.name, a.company, a.num, stopb.name AS transfer_stop
		  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
		  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
		  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
		  WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart') first_bus 
	JOIN (SELECT stopa.name AS transfer_stop, a.company, a.num, stopb.name
		  FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
		  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
		  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
		  WHERE stopb.name = 'Sighthill') second_bus 
	ON first_bus.transfer_stop = second_bus.transfer_stop
ORDER BY CAST(first_bus.num AS int)
