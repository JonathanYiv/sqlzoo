Lesson

1) SELECT yr, subject, winner
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1950;

2) SELECT winner
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr = 1962
   AND subject = 'Literature';

3) SELECT yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE winner = 'Albert Einstein';

4) SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'Peace'
AND yr >= 2000;

5) SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'Literature'
AND yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;

6) SELECT * FROM nobel
 WHERE winner IN ('Theodore Roosevelt',
                  'Woodrow Wilson',
                  'Jimmy Carter', 'Barack Obama');

7) SELECT winner
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'John%';

8) SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject = 'Physics' AND yr = 1980) OR (subject = 'Chemistry' AND yr = 1984);

9) SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1980 AND subject <> 'Chemistry' AND subject <> 'Medicine';

10) SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE (subject = 'Medicine' AND yr < 1910) OR (subject = 'Literature' AND yr >= 2004);

11) SELECT *
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'PETER GR_NBERG';

12) SELECT *
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'EUGENE O\'NEILL';

13) SELECT winner, yr, subject
FROM nobel
WHERE winner LIKE 'Sir%'
ORDER BY yr DESC, winner;

14) SELECT winner, subject
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr=1984
 ORDER BY subject IN ('Physics', 'Chemistry'), subject, winner;

This one is cool because it takes 
subject IN ('Physics', 'Chemistry') as a value of 0 or 1 and sorts by it accordingly.

WHERE yr NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT yr FROM nobel WHERE subject = 'Medicine')
