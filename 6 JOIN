Lesson

1) SELECT matchid, player FROM goal WHERE teamid = 'GER';

2) SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2 FROM game WHERE id = 1012;

3) SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate
FROM goal JOIN game ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = 'GER';

4) SELECT team1, team2, player
FROM goal JOIN game ON id = matchid
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%';

5) SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
FROM goal JOIN eteam ON teamid = id
WHERE gtime <= 10;

6) SELECT mdate, teamname 
FROM game JOIN eteam ON team1 = eteam.id
WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos';

7) SELECT player 
FROM goal JOIN game ON matchid = id 
WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';

8) SELECT DISTINCT player
FROM goal JOIN game ON matchid = id
WHERE (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER')
AND teamid <> 'GER';

9) SELECT eteam.teamname, COUNT(teamid)
FROM goal JOIN eteam ON teamid = id
GROUP BY teamid, teamname;

10) SELECT stadium, COUNT(matchid) 
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid 
GROUP BY stadium;

11) SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(matchid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate;

12) SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(matchid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate;

13) SELECT mdate, team1, 
					SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, team2, 
					SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON id = matchid
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;

# It selects five different columns.
# mdate is the date of the game from the table 'game'
# team1 is the name of team one from the table 'game'
# team2 is the name of team two from the table 'game'
# score1 and score2 are both produced using SUM and CASE WHEN
# For score1, when teamid is the same as team1, then it adds 1 to the sum. If the teamid is null, then it adds 0 to the sum.
# For score2, when teamid is the same as team2, then it adds 1 to the sum. If the teamid is null, then it adds 0 to the sum.
# The tables 'game' and 'goal' are joined together on id = matchid.
# The reason a LEFT JOIN is necessary is because matches without any goals scored will not match in a traditional INNER JOIN and be dropped, 
# whereas a LEFT JOIN will not drop but instead fill the values with null, allowing the case statement above to function properly
# It is grouped by mdate, matchid, team1, and team2, although matchid is unnecessary


/* Thought Process
Goal: List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown.

Need CASE WHEN

This selects the whole table
SELECT * FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid


Score for Team 1
SELECT matchid, COUNT(teamid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = team1
GROUP BY matchid, teamid

Score for Team 2
SELECT matchid, COUNT(teamid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = team2
GROUP BY matchid, teamid


This produces the mdate, team1, score1, team2, but not score2
SELECT mdate, team1, COUNT(teamid), team2
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = team1
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;


This creates all the necessary columns, but the values are wrong, including not accounting for zeroes
SELECT mdate, team1, COUNT(teamid), team2, COUNT(teamid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = CASE teamid WHEN team1 THEN team1
						   WHEN team2 THEN team2
			   END
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;


does not work either
SELECT mdate, team1, COUNT(teamid) AS one, team2, COUNT(teamid) AS two
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE one = CASE one WHEN team1 THEN team1 WHEN team2 THEN team2 END
AND two = CASE two  WHEN team1 THEN team1 WHEN team2 THEN team2 END
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;


Nope...
SELECT mdate, team1, COUNT(CASE teamid WHEN teamid = team1 THEN teamid ELSE 0), team2, COUNT(teamid) AS score2
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid

GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;


Joining the two scores did not work either...
SELECT * FROM
(SELECT mdate, team1, COUNT(teamid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = team1
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, teamid) x
JOIN
(SELECT team2, COUNT(teamid)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
WHERE teamid = team2
GROUP BY matchid, team2, teamid) y
ON x.matchid = y.matchid

SELECT mdate, team1, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, team2, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;

QUIZ

1) game JOIN goal ON id = matchid

2) matchid, teamid, player, gtime, id, teamname, coach

3) SELECT player, teamid, COUNT(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE (team1 = 'GRE' OR team2 = 'GRE')
AND teamid != 'GRE'
GROUP BY player, teamid

4) Table-A

5) SELECT DISTINCT player, teamid
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
AND (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
AND teamid != 'POL'

6) SELECT DISTINCT player, teamid, gtime
FROM game JOIN goal on matchid = id
WHERE stadium = 'Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)'
AND (( teamid = team2 AND team1 != 'ITA' ) OR ( teamid = team1 AND team2 != 'ITA' ))

7) Table-B
