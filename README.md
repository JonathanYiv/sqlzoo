# SQL Zoo Project

The goal of this project is to put into practice SQL queries using the online resource [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sql).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

In between this and the last project, I've been down two rabbit holes: creating my own [personal blog/resume/portfolio website](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/jonathanyiv.github.io) and attending a Career Fair.

I fell down this rabbit holes midway through the SQL lesson content so I am feeling a bit uneasy and out of the flow.

Hopefully this puts me back on track!
