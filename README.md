# SQL Zoo Project

The goal of this project is to put into practice SQL queries using the online resource [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sql).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

In between this and the last project, I've been down two rabbit holes: creating my own [personal blog/resume/portfolio website](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/jonathanyiv.github.io) and attending a Career Fair.

I fell down this rabbit holes midway through the SQL lesson content so I am feeling a bit uneasy and out of the flow.

Hopefully this puts me back on track!

## Post-Project Thoughts

1. This caused me to go down my second batch of rabbit holes for SQL, especially considering I have a job lead involving SQL. Here's a list of resources I personally found valuable:

	1. [Khan Academy's SQL Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql): Decent, although the introduction of concepts is too fast-paced for a beginner.

	2. [CalebTheVideoMaker2's SQL Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Pr1VgPK4w&list=PL_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID): Still working my way through this one. I'll update with an opinion later.

	3. [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com): By far, the best introduction to SQL.

	4. [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com): The best SQL explanation by far. Very well-explained. I'd recommend SQL Teaching first, then SQL Bolt, then the video course or khan's course if you want more practice.

2. SQLZoo was way harder and took way longer than I thought. All in all, there were about four to five questions that blew my mind. I even opened a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46385904/self-joins-difference-between-queries-sql-zoo) on one of the questions where I didn't fully understand the answer.

3. I am very happy I made it through SQLZoo, though. It was a fun challenge.
